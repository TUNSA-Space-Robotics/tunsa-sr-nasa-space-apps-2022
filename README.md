# TUNSA Space Robotics' Project Submission during NASA International Space Apps 2022
This is a repository containing the project we submitted during NASA Space Apps 2022. This year, we participated in solving the [Outfitting a Mars Habitat: A 3D Print Challenge](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/mars-habitat). The goal is to design tools, furniture, and other items to assist an astronaut on a one-year mission to Mars.
