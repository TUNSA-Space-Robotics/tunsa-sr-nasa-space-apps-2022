# Designing Multi-purpose Resource-Efficient Equipment for a Mars Habitat

### NASA Space Apps 2022, TUNSA Space Robotics

**Technologies:** SOLIDWORKS, 3D Printing, In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU), Multi-purpose Design

## Introduction

This project focuses on the design and optimization of multi-purpose equipment essential for a 1-year astronaut mission on Mars. Leveraging advanced SOLIDWORKS functionalities and in-depth knowledge of resource utilization, the project aimed to maximize efficiency and sustainability in Mars habitat equipment design, while ensuring compatibility with the constraints of available 3D printers.

## Project Scope

The project, conducted from October 1, 2022, to October 2, 2022, was submitted during NASA Space Apps 2022 by a team of 6 members from TUNSA Space Robotics as a proposed solution to the [Outfitting a Mars Habitat: A 3D Print Challenge](https://2022.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/2022-challenges/mars-habitat).

## Technical Details

- **Resource-Efficient Design**: We designed 31 essential tools, furniture, and equipment, optimizing the use of indigenous resources such as regolith and CO2-derived polymer materials. This approach resulted in a 32% reduction in composite consumption, contributing to sustainability and resource conservation.

- **Modular Multi-function Tools**: One of our key innovations was the engineering of modular tools, such as a screwdriver with an integrated wrench and a fractal vise embedded in a concrete workbench. These designs not only reduced the total number of items required but also lowered costs by 42% and ensured efficient resource utilization.

- **Improved Rover Wheel Design**: Recognizing the importance of mobility on Martian terrain, we focused on enhancing rover wheel design. Our replacement wheel featured deeper treads and a closed outboard face, aligning with previous rover specifications and improving sand traction by 22%.

- **Ergonomic Considerations**: We prioritized astronaut comfort and resource conservation by leveraging plastic handles for tools. This decision not only enhanced ergonomics but also minimized the use of difficult-to-obtain metals, contributing to sustainability goals.

- **Manufacturability**: To ensure ease of manufacturing, we designed items with minimal overhangs and incorporated support structures where necessary. This approach facilitated efficient production in Martian conditions, considering limitations in resources and manufacturing capabilities.
